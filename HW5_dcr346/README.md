# README HW5_dcr346

## Assignment 1: Test the Z test
Worked on most of it with Emily, Rebbeca, Matt and Sarah. Did the samples plotting by my own.

## Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit
Worked with Emily, Rebbeca and Matt. 

Setting the narray was a bit challenging but the plots 'explained' themselves that we needed to sort the narray first.

Scipy documentation was helpful and quite understandable and I feel I learned much about the different tests for goodness of fit.

## Assignment 3: regression exercise
Worked with Emily and Rebbeca. 
Did most of the data downloading and merging by my own, got little help from Julian.

Issues occured:

1. Didn't succeed with calling for the PUIDATA environmental variable; the path seemed alright but from some reason it did not work. **please download the four csv files from this HW5_dcr346 directory**

2. I guess I didn't plot the WLS as I should > the WLS line looks the same as the OLS (ax3.subplot).
