## Assignment 1: Test the Z test
Worked on most of it with Emily, Rebbeca, Matt and Sarah. The samples plotting I did by my own.

## Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit
Worked with Emily and Rebbeca. 

Setting the narray was a bit challenging but the plots 'explained' themselves that we needed to sort the narray first.

Scipy documentation was helpful and quite understandable and I feel I learned much about the different tests for goodness of fit.

## Assignment 3: regression exercise
Worked with Emily and Rebbeca. 
Did most of the data downloading and merging by my own, got little help from Julian.

Didn't got to plot the WLS as I should > the WLS looks the same as the OLS.
