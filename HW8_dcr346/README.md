## HW8_dcr346 Creating a Plot Assignment

# Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough
Worked alone on this assignment.

The objective of this assignment was to get a picture of the urban development level / situation of the city by viewing the amount of permits issued, categorically seperated by permit types, for each of all 5 New York City's boroughs. Data were retrieved from [CUSP Data Facility DOB permit issuance data](http://urbanprofiler.cloudapp.net/dataset/ipu4-2q9a/)

For the code used to generate the following plot please see the attached [Ipython Notebook](https://github.com/danachermesh/PUI2017_dcr346/blob/master/HW8_dcr346/HW8_dcr346.ipynb)

### Fig.1 Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough, years 2015-2017
It is clear that **Brooklyn** and **Queens** are relatively more developing and / or changing, with large numbers of permits from the three selected types. These two boroughs have also the highest numbers of _New Buildings_ permissions, as well as _demolishings_ (= Earthwork). **Manhattan**, which we know is also facing a rapidly urban development, seems to experience it more in the building _Alternations_ level rather than in new constructions. This makes sense due to the lack of free space in Manhattan and its high density urban areas. **Staten Island** and **Bronx** are the less developing botoughs of the city, as we could have guessed.

## Jack Lundquist Comments for HW9:
Overall, I think this graphic is really great. The color scheme is nice, the figure is the proper size, all the labels and legends and axes are super clear (I really like the slanted borough labels and the general "Borough" label!). Your description and interpretation paragraph is detailed, interesting and clear. It helped point me to some interesting insights in the graph I wouldn't have seen at first glance! One think I would consider is how the permit axis is or is not normalized - in most instances it makes sense to normalize data disaggregated spatially by area or maybe even population, but then again I think in this instance it may make sense to have it be displayed as the sum total. Great job overall!
