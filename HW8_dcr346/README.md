### Fig.1 Permit Issuance by Permit Type and Borough, years 2015-2017
It is clear that **Brooklyn** and **Queens** are relatively more developing and / or changing, with large numbers of permits from the three selected types. These two boroughs have also the highest numbers of _New Buildings_ permissions, as well as _demolishings_ (= Earthwork). **Manhattan**, which we know is also facing a rapidly urban development, seems to experience it more in the building _Alternations_ level rather than in new constructions. This makes sense due to the lack of free space in Manhattan and its high density urban areas. **Staten Island** and **Bronx** are the less developing botoughs of the city, as we could have guessed.
