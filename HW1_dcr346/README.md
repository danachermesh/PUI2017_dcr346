# PUI2017_dcr346
# Setting up my environment:

**How did I set	up my environment:**

1. Followed the	Assignment2 instructions and created on	CUSP compute a directory called	PUI2017.

2. Using "export" I created the	variable that points to	PUI2017	directory and "alias" to create	the alias "\
pui2017".

The first screenshot is	me checking my alias at	bash:

![Alt text](screenshots/screenshot1_bash.png)

The second screenshot is of the	vi where I set the 'export' and 'alias' commands:

![Alt text](screenshots/screenshot2_vi.png)

3. I got out of CUSP compute and cloned the PUI2017 directory to my local machine, moved (through terminal)\
  the screenshots which were by then on my home desktop to a new sub-folder "screenshots".

4. Opened "README" in atom and put the screenshots in it; then opened the README at emacs to describe my wo\
rkflow.

5. Will	git add, git commit -m "updated README", git push origin master (hope that will work out well :))
