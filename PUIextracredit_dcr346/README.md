# Residential Building Permits Issuance and Housing Violations
## Problem Description:
My motivation for this assignment is to analyze how does the number of residential permits issuance correlate with housing violations number, if at all, and by this to identify areas that should get more attention regarding building codes and building use validation. I relate to permit issuance as an indicator of urban renewal, due to the fact that the majority of construction in New York City requires a Department of Buildings permit to make sure that the plans are in compliance with Building Code (from nyc.gov). I pre assume that an area with a very low number of residential permits issued over a year (meaning, an area that is less developing / renewing) will also have a relatively large number of building violation (illegal conversion). I also guess there are highly renewing areas with large number of permits issued and a large number of building violation complaints. Additionally, I am interested in assessing the roll of income in the predicting of housing violations.
