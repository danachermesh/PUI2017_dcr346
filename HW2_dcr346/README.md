# PUI2017_dcr346/HW2_dcr346 - README.md

## Assignment #1:

Worked with several other students, primarily with Prince and Sarah 
- Learned from Sarah about the Json formatter for Google Chrome which made everything much more clear.
- Prince help me to better understand the difference between indexing a list and range(len(list)).
- Felt pretty good with navigating through the Json type of data structure.
- The code was first writen in Jupyter notebook. After running it in notebook I copied it to emacs (through terminal) and changed the url to suit to a py script with the variables and sys.argv[] > the methode was understandable to me.

## Assignment #2:
