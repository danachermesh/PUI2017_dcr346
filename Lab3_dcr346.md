## Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below: ##

### 1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? ###
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Testable Hypothesis:
#### the average % of fat lost is significantly higher within the diet candidates in comparison to the exercise candidates 
Null Hypothesis: 
#### the average % of fat lost is equal / lower within the diet candidates in comparison to the exercise candidates 

H0: Pt <= Pc
H1: Pt > Pc

### 2. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223) ###
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Testable Hypothesis:
#### the average IQ for children aged 1,2,3 and 4 is significantly lower for those whose mother smoked while pregnant with them.
* The most recent test gives the permanent effect
* The first test gives the immidiate effect

Null Hypothesis: 
#### the average IQ for children aged 1,2,3 and 4 is equal / higher for those whose mother smoked (10 or more cigarates a day) while pregnant with them.

### 3. Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes ###
#### Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

Observational experiment
