## Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below: ##

### 1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? ###
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Testable Hypothesis:
the % of fat lost is significantly higher within the diet candidates in comparison to the exercise candidates in a period of 3 mounths

Null Hypothesis: 
the % of fat lost is equal / lower within the diet candidates in comparison to the exercise candidates in a period of 3 mounths

### 2. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223) ###
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Testable Hypothesis:
the average IQ for children aged 1,2,3 and 4 is significantly lower for those whose mother smoked while pregnant with them.

Null Hypothesis: 
the average IQ for children aged 1,2,3 and 4 is equal / higher for those whose mother smoked while pregnant with them.

### 3. Contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. 
This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
