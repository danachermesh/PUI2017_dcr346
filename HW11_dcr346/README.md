# HW11_dcr346
# Time series clustering exercise

Worked with Rebecca, Matt, Emily and Prince. 

Acquiring the data was the hardest and longest part; though after discussion + hint email from Dr. Bianco we read the data in carefully using for loops and no kernel had died. The data cleaning part was understandable to me. Prince shared with us the .pivot function that arranged the data into time series of each Zipcode's establishments.

We standardizing the data using .preprocessing.scale function and verified the new series had std of 1.

For the KMeans clustering task I used an _elbow function_ from ADS (Applied Data Sceince) class. Had trouble that I didn't get to solve with plotting the centers of the five clusters.

Also, conducted DBScan clustering algorithm, relying on Dr. Bianco's notebook example. Again, had trouble with plotting the result.

Merging my scaled DataFrame with NYC Zipcode shp was clear, though the map doesn't look like the example in this assignment instructions notebook.

Didn't get to finish this assignment.

# KMeans in class lab

On this assignment I worked alone and followed the notebook from class, searched online the pl.cla() function to clean the figure from previews content.
