1. The NULL hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are formed correctly
2. The dataframe is formed correctly
3. I would pick chi-square to test the hypothesis, since the variables are catagorical (male/female) and the counts are ordinal.

* additional comments: 
  * The current dessign is only reflecting results of the current month and is not generalizable without knowing the men and women riding at midnight distribution at the population level. 
  * Maybe we can do the same comparison for different age group, it would be interesting to see if the distribution of ratio of midnight bikers for men and women across different age group.
  * In the future, we should also include data sets from different month and see if the results still holds and statistically signifficant.
