1. The NULL hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are formed correctly
2. The dataframe is formed correctly
3. I would pick student's t-test to test the hypothesis, since we have a large sample size but we don't have the population variance.

* additional comments: maybe we can do the same comparison with different age group. or see if it still holds when we compare weekdays and weekends.
