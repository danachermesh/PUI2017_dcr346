 ## Assignment#1
 #### Forked pak348's repo, reviewed HW3_Assignment2
 Worked alone. Please see the [forked repo](https://github.com/danachermesh/PUI2017_pak348) in my GitHub; also see **CitibikeReview_dcr346.md** file in this HW4_dcr346 directory, also copied to pak348's forked reposetory.
 
 ## Assignment#2
 Worked alone.
 
 ## Assignment#3
  Worked alone.
  
  Felt this assignment really gained me a deeper knowledge about the tests and the workflow of each one of it.
  
 ## Assignment#4
 I worked with several students, primary with Emily, Rebecca, Jack and Prince.
 I didn't succeed using Dr. Bianco's getcitibikedata function, so I downloaded the data from Citibike open data and read it directly. Please see the .zip file in this current HW4_dcr346 directory.
 
 Dr. Bianco's office hours helped me to better understand the theory and method of the statistical tests.
